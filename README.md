A Minecraft server proxy with unparalleled server support, scalability,
and flexibility.

Velocity-CTD is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## Goals

* A codebase that is easy to dive into and consistently follows best practices
  for Java projects as much as reasonably possible.
* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.
* A new, refreshing API built from the ground up to be flexible and powerful
  whilst avoiding design mistakes and suboptimal designs from other proxies.
* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, Fabric and Forge. (Other implementations
  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations
  specifically.)
* Features that deliver an "all-in-one" experience with various features that
  we believe every network wants and needs.

## Additional Features/Removals

* Utilization of newer dependencies for virtually any dependency that can
  easily and fairly be upgraded, to maintain the highest level of performance.
* Implementation of non-invasive multi-forwarding system that allows you
  to use a different forwarding method for specific servers on the backend.
* Configurable `/alert` command sends messages across your entire network.
* Configurable `/alertraw` command to send non-prefixed messages across your
  entire network.
* Configurable `/find` command that locates yourself and other users.
* `/hub` with `/lobby` alias that sends you to the/a fallback server,
  which synchronizes with the activation and deactivation of dynamic fallbacks.
* Configurable `/ping` command that displays your and other users' ping.
* The `/send` supports sending users from `{SERVER_FROM}` to `{SERVER_TO}`.
* Configurable `/showall` command that displays all users connected to a specific
  instance rather than flooding your chat with users connected everywhere.
* Configurable `/velocity uptime` command to view how long your proxy has been online for.
* Implementation of configurable `/server {SERVER}` access for tab completion and
  command execution.
* Choice implementation that allows you to fully strip, reload, and remove commands
  present in regular Velocity and require/force deactivation of commands for
  plugin overrides.
* Configurable value to disable translation for header and footer for Velocity to
  improve performance in plugins like TAB that do not need it.
* Configurable minimum version value that allows users to block users on versions
  older than your desired minimum server version (synchronizes with outdated pinger).
* Fallback servers allow users to be sent to the least populated server,
  which will cycle for even distribution.
* Configurable server brand and server pinger message (outdated and fallback).
* Configurable removal of unsigned message kick/disconnection events for plugins
  with improper compatibility.
* Configurable deactivation of Forge inbound handshakes for servers that do not
  run Forge or NeoForge as their server software.
* Other miscellaneous optimizations and tweaks that will only continue to be
  implemented as this fork matures.
* Preliminary MiniMessage support to permit full configurability of all Velocity
  messages, alongside `/velocity reload`able translations, alongside `/velocity reload`able
  server additions/removals inside the `velocity.toml`.
* Removal of all language files except `messages.properties` to preserve
  maintainability. PRs are welcome to reimplement all language files
  with our changes.
* Fix for users with poor connections getting stuck in the configuration phase by
  immediately removing them upon disconnection, using player teardown. (Issue: [#1251](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity/issues/1251))

## Velocity-CTD Permissions
* `velocity.command.alert` [/alert]
* `velocity.command.alertraw` [/alertraw]
* `velocity.command.find` [/find]
* `velocity.command.hub` [/hub & /lobby]
* `velocity.command.ping` [/ping]
* `velocity.command.showall` [/showall]
* `velocity.command.uptime` [/velocity uptime]

## Building

Velocity is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org). We recommend using the
wrapper script (`./gradlew`) as our CI builds using it.

It is sufficient to run `./gradlew build` to run the full build cycle.

You can find new releases of Velocity-CTD in our [releases](https://github.com/GemstoneGG/Velocity-CTD/releases) tab,
where our latest updates will be compiled and ready for use.

## Running

Once you've built Velocity, you can copy and run the `-all` JAR from
`proxy/build/libs`. Velocity will generate a default configuration file,
and you can configure it from there.
